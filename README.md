# TheMarchTowardsCode

Hello this is a personal guide for me to document my journey.\
Ultimately trying to practice and get comfortable publicly share code! (and sometimes my thoughts 😅)\
We will see how long I can commit to this.\
Hopefully I can work and add on this every day in March and beyond!

Wanted to squash my fear of posting.
> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. \

With this I have a few goals in mind:
- Work on LeetCode/HackerRank/DSA Practice Problems
- Learn and get more comfortable with git and commiting to a repo
- Mess around with New Concepts/Data Structures that I come across
- Implement small projects
- Turn this into a habit 
- Have fun with it while sharing the joy😁
